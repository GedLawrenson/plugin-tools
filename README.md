  * retrievesigner.jar

    Tiny java utility to grab the root CA from a port and either dump it to a
    file or directly add it to plugin-key.kdb.  This is useful for fixing the most
    common forms of GSKit 414 errors, where the WAS root CA is simply not present
    in plugin-key.kdb.  Note: If you subsequently propagate the same keystore from
    the dmgr to the webserver (which is the preferred way to ensure the right CAs
    are trusted) any changes from this tool will be lost.
